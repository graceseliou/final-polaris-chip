     <!-- as a music enthusiast, i found this project to be the perfect opportunity for me to blog about one of
     my favorite things to talk about - my spotify playlists. this will be my first time blogging and creating
     an entire webpage (relatively) using html/css/js, so it's going to be fresh. i'm hoping it can serve as the
     blueprint for an ongoing project that i'll add to as i go through my career as a woman in technology.  -->

    <!-- the first album i'd like to share about is titled "back to the future", referencing the 1985 hit movie that i've
    actually never watched. it's a mix of songs from the 2000s and early 2010s that shaped my childhood - a time where
    my main method of consuming music was through the car radio and by searching questionable lyrics using the youtube 
    search bar. it's the only playlist that i have continuously added to over the years as i remember banger after banger.
    the first track, 1999 by charli xcx and troye sivan was released in 2018, which might seem somewhat recent. that's 
    because every masterpiece has to start somewhere, and this song was the one that inspired me to create this playlist. 
    something about charli and troye singing about taking them back to 1999 resonated with me, despite not having been born. -->
